            <h3>Life of Dr. Kalam:</h3>
            <p id="info">Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam (15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist and president. He was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts. He came to be known
                as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.<br>
                <br> Kalam was elected as the 11th President of India in 2002. Widely referred to as the "People's President", he returned to his civilian life after a single term. He was a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat
                Ratna. <br>
                <br> While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from an apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83. Thousands, including national-level dignitaries, attended the funeral ceremony
                held in his hometown of Rameswaram, where he was buried with full state honours. </p>
